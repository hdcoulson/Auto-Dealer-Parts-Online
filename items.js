      mediaHeading: 'BRAKES',
      itemDescription: 'When it comes to brakes – bigger is better. Adding a performance Big Brake kit makes sense because it allows you to improve the braking performance of your vehicle to compliment the performance gains from increased power and handling. All wheels are not created equal and each wheel design has its own assets and liabilities. Steel wheels are inexpensive, easy to produce, and come "stock" on many vehicles. Steel wheels can be "dressed up" with a set of hubcaps. Aluminum alloy wheels (also known as alloy wheels), have some serious advantages over steel wheels – they are lighter, dissipate heat better and provide good rigidity under high-load cornering maneuvers. There are three basic types of alloy wheel construction: forged, billet and cast.',
      itemDetails: 'Each brake kit includes: e-coated non-friction surface, four-piston opposed fixed calipers, cross-drilled rotors, performance ceramic compound brake pads.',

      mediaHeading: 'FILTERS',
      itemDescription: 'Increase performance with reusable Air Filters. The free-flowing design allows for maximum air to enter your engine with minimal resistance, free of damaging debris.By reducing the amount of junk getting into your engine while increasing airflow, TRD Performance Air Filters can give your engine added power and better fuel economy. Enhancing the clean air flow without disturbing the calibration of the mass airflow sensor results in smoother, easier air intake and better overall performance without negative side-effects.',
      itemDetails: 'Free-flowing high-performance air filter design provides engine protection, while potentially increasing engine output. Allows the maximum amount of air into the engine with the minimal amount of resistance. Washable and reusable—regular cleaning ensures free airflow and top performance. Designed to last the lifetime of the vehicle. ',

      itemDescription: 'Wheel design can make or break the look of a car. Every performance wheel incorporates the proper weight, offset and brake clearance to ensure that you get proper fit, finish and reliability. All wheels are not created equal and each wheel design has its own assets and liabilities. Steel wheels are inexpensive, easy to produce, and come "stock" on many vehicles. Steel wheels can be "dressed up" with a set of hubcaps.

      mediaHeading: 'EXHAUST',
      itemDescription: 'In a four-stroke engine, the exhaust cycle is the last step in the process when the burned gasses are expelled from the engine. The exhaust valve opens at the beginning of the exhaust stroke, and then the piston pushes the burnt gasses out of the cylinder. If there is any resistance that the piston has to push against to force the exhaust gasses out, power is wasted. This is known as back pressure. Therefore, the goal is to get the burnt gasses out of the engine and  exhaust system as efficiently as possible. These gasses travel through the exhaust port into the exhaust manifold, then travel through the exhaust pipe to the catalytic converter and muffler, and finally vent to the environment.',
      itemDetails: 'Polished muffler body—exclusively built of 304 stainless steel—features a double-walled body and delivers an increase in vehicle horsepower as well as a more resonant engine sound. Axle-back muffler featuring stainless steel pipes and large polished exhaust tip. Emissions legal in all 50 states.',
